TPMCalculator
===

TPMCalculator quantifies mRNA abundance directly from the alignments by parsing BAM files. 
The input parameters are the same GTF files used to generate the alignments, and one or 
multiple input BAM file(s) containing either single-end or paired-end sequencing reads. 
The TPMCalculator output is comprised of four files per sample reporting the TPM values 
and raw read counts for genes, transcripts, exons and introns respectively.

## Requirements

### BAMTools

Clone the BAMTools repository from GitHub: https://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools

Compile it on this way and set the environment variables for TPMCalculator:

    cd bamtools
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    cd ..
    export BAMTOOLS_DIR=`pwd`
    export CPPFLAGS="-I $BAMTOOLS_DIR/include"
    export LDFLAGS="-L $BAMTOOLS_DIR/lib -Wl,-rpath,$BAMTOOLS_DIR/lib"

That's it. BAMTools was compiled and the env variables were set for compiling
TPMCalculator.

## Installation

After the installation of BAMTools go to the TPMCalculator folder and do make:

    make

A bin folder will be created with the TPMCalculator executable.

## Usage

Usage: ./bin/TPMCalculator -g GTF_file [-d BAM_files_directory|-i BAM_file] 

    ./bin/TPMCalculator options:

        -v    Print info
        -h    Display this usage information.
        -g    GTF file
        -d    Directory with the BAM files
        -b    BAM file
        -k    Gene key to use from GTF file. Default: gene_id
        -t    Transcript key to use from GTF file. Default: transcript_id
        -c    Smaller size allowed for an intron created for genes. Default: 16. We recommend to use the reads length
        -p    Use only properly paired reads. Default: No. Recommended for paired-end reads.
        -q    Minimum MAPQ value to filter out reads. Default: 0. This value depends on the aligner MAPQ value.
        -o    Minimum overlap between a reads and a feature. Default: 8.

## Description

The model to describe the genomic features used for a gene is created from the GTF provided 
by the user. TPMCalculator performs two transformations which are executed on the genomic 
coordinates generating regions for the genes that include the exons and “pure” intron 
regions as shown in Figure S1. The first transformation creates overlapped exons for 
all alternative spliced forms of the genes. A single gene model is generated with unique 
exons and introns which includes the sequence of all exonic regions. The second transformation 
process creates a list of pure intron regions that replace those generated by the first 
transformation. We should indicate that only the intron regions are modified to generate 
regions not overlapped by exons of other genes. Reporting TPM values for these unique 
introns allows further identification of alternative splicing events like intron retention.
Additionally, a set of non-overlapped gene features (exons and introns) are generated and 
used for TPM calculation.

To validate our software, we calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between TPM and FPKM 
for normalized expression values using RNA-Seq data of 1,256 samples from 
the TCGA-BRCA project.

Additionally, the correlation coefficient was also calculated for the raw read counts 
reported by TPMCalculator, HTSeq and featureCounts.

TPMCalculator reduces the compute time and the resource requirements of RNA-Seq pipelines 
by eliminating multiple steps. For example, TPMCalculator processes BAM files of size 7.0 GB 
in ~20 minutes requiring only 4GB of RAM.
